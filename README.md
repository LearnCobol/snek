# Snek
Basic snake game written in COBOL.

## Building
### Installing Open COBOL
`sudo apt-get install open-cobol`

I used 1.1.0 while developing this.


### Compiling
`make`

## Playing
`./snake`

The game is on a 10x10 grid with wrap-around.

The snake starts in the top-left and moves downward.

Currently the food spawning locations will always be the same.

### Controls
w/a/s/d are used to move the snake around.

q will exit the game.
